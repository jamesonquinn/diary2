2015/3/20 Friday I read about the twitter usage of some of the female ISIS members, and how twitter was used in the recruitment of female members. Often times, those young women were second-generation immigrants born in countries such as U.K., France or the U.S. The usage of modern technology here is interesting in its own right, but I thought it would also be interesting to do a network analysis, drawing on those women’s online presence. What do their online networks look like in terms of network density and size? What kinds of individuals occupy the key network positions? Who are the brokers? 2015/3/28-29 Saturday/SundayI read (rather serendipitously) online that a PhD student from Michigan State named Randal Olson computed the optimal road trip routes across the U.S. and the Europe with the genetic algorithm using Python. How fun! And the thought to myself: what a wonderful way to procrastinate!I have never really used Python before- but have always wanted to learn it. So the entire weekend was spent trying to duplicate Randal Olson’s example- starting from installing packages, understanding his coding, getting the program he wrote to run on my computer, and finally making my own (tiny) changes. I did end up making an optimal road trip route across China, following Randal’s example closely. And I would like to think that I learnt a little bit Python along the way.
